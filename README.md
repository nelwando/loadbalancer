# Load Balancing Like It's 1999
Implementation of a basic, software-based load-balancer, operating at layer 4.

## Introduction
This project seeks to provide a solution to the problem statement below.  It was implemented over the course of a 72 hour period between 18th - 20th September 2025.

### Problem Statement
Itâ€™s 1999.  You, are a software engineer working at a rapidly growing scale-up.

The company has outgrown its start-up era, single server setup.  Things are starting to fail rapidly.  You are tasked with designing and building a software-based load balancer to allow multiple machines to handle the load.

The task is to implement a basic, software-based load-balancer, operating at layer 4.

## Projects
There are two projects that were created as part of the total solution which are explained below.

### v1999
This project provides the implementation of the load balancer.  See the [v1999 README](./v1999/README.md) for further information.

### testinfrastructure
This projects provides the implementation of a test server and client that can be used to exercise the load balancer.  See the [testinfrastructure README](./testinfrastructure/README.md) for further information.
